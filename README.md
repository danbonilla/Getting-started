Getting-started
===============
Ruby on Rails Micro Blog 
========================

GA WDI DC October 2014, First Project

=======================

Overview
========

This will be my first solo project using Ruby on Rails. I will create a micro blog in homage to one of the most popular apps that have been created using Rails; Twitter. Since I am just beginning to work with Rails, this project will be used to help me build a solid foundation from which to build more web apps in the future. In this phase my blog will have allow user to sign in and have access to their feed, allow them to create posts, and comments. The posts will accept text and also allow the user to upload photos. In future phases, I plan on adding the social aspect that will allow users to follow other users and be followed as well, I will also add functionality that will use  mailers to authenticate emails when signing up, and allow users to reset passwords if they forgot them.
